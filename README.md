<h1>eStore Billing System using C</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a C program that takes user input for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation and analyzes it to provide a weather report. It uses if-else statements to determine the type of weather and outputs whether it's hot, pleasant, cool or cold, humid, dry or moderate, and calm, breezy or windy. It also indicates the likelihood of precipitation. The program can be useful for getting an idea of the current weather conditions in a specific location.
