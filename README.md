<h1>eStore Billing System using C</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a C program that simulates an e-store checkout process. The program begins by declaring variables to hold customer information, product values, and a total value. It then displays the store information and a list of items available for purchase. The program prompts the user to enter their customer information and select items to add to their cart using a do-while loop and a switch statement. The program calculates the total cost of the selected items and displays it to the user. Finally, the program thanks the user for shopping and terminates.
